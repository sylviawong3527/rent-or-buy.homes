# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A production-ready buy vs rent calculator that helps users compare long-term net-worth outcomes between buying a home and renting while investing the savings. The app is 100% client-side (no backend), deployed on Vercel at [rent-or-buy.homes](https://rent-or-buy.homes).

## Current Implementation Status

**The application is feature-complete and production-ready.** All major features are implemented:

- ✅ **Complete UI/UX**: Full responsive design with all input panels, charts, and visualizations
- ✅ **Financial Engine**: Sophisticated calculations with mortgage amortization, tax optimization, and investment projections
- ✅ **Internationalization**: Full English/Chinese support via i18next with browser language detection
- ✅ **URL State Sync**: Shareable links with LZ-compressed state parameters
- ✅ **Charts & Visualizations**: ApexCharts integration for net worth and cash outflow projections
- ✅ **City Presets**: Pre-configured market data for major US cities
- ✅ **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics integration

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] PDF export functionality for detailed reports
- [ ] Additional chart types for advanced financial projections
- [ ] More city presets and regional data

```

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

- **State Management**: Centralized via React Context with `useReducer` for predictable updates
- **Calculations**: Pure TypeScript functions in `src/lib/finance/` - no side effects, easy to test
- **URL Sync**: Automatic bidirectional sync between app state and URL parameters using `useURLSync` hook
- **i18n Integration**: Language state managed in AppContext, synced with i18next on language changes

## Financial Calculation Engine

The core calculation logic is in `src/lib/finance/calculations.ts`. All functions are pure (no side effects) for testability.

### Key Calculations

**Mortgage Amortization** (`calculateMonthlyPayment`, `buildAmortizationSchedule`)
- Standard PMT formula for monthly payment calculation
- Full amortization schedule with principal/interest breakdown per payment
- Handles scenarios where loan is paid off before projection horizon

**Property Appreciation** (`calculatePropertyAppreciation`)
- Compound annual growth: `FV = PV × (1 + r)^n`
- Customizable appreciation rates

**Investment Growth** (`calculateInvestmentReturns`)
- Portfolio growth with annual contributions (differential cash flow between scenarios)
- Compound returns with reinvestment

**Tax Calculations**
- Mortgage interest deduction (itemized vs. standard deduction comparison)
- Property capital gains with $250k/$500k exemptions (single/married filing)
- Investment capital gains (long-term vs. short-term rates)
- Different marginal tax rates by filing status

**Cash Flow & Net Worth**
- Year-by-year cash outflow tracking for both scenarios
- Final net worth calculation includes:
  - Property value minus remaining mortgage balance and selling costs
  - Investment portfolio value minus capital gains tax
- "Same money in" principle: when one scenario costs less in a year, the difference is invested

### Calculation Reference

An Excel version of the calculator is available at `reference/validate.xlsx` for manual validation of calculation logic.

## Important Implementation Details

### State Management Pattern

The app uses a centralized state management pattern via `AppContext`:

```typescript
// State is managed via useReducer with action-based updates
const { state, dispatch } = useApp();

// Update patterns:
updateBuyInput(field, value)    // Buy scenario inputs
updateRentInput(field, value)   // Rent scenario inputs
updateAppSetting(field, value)  // App-level settings (time horizon, language)
```

All calculations are derived from state in `useCalculations` hook, not stored in state themselves. This ensures calculations always reflect current inputs.

### URL Synchronization Pattern

`useURLSync` hook provides bidirectional sync:
- **State → URL**: Whenever state changes, URL is updated via `history.replaceState`
- **URL → State**: On mount, URL params are parsed and applied to state
- Compression via `lz-string` keeps URLs shareable despite large state objects

### Internationalization Pattern

- Translation files in `src/locales/en/` and `src/locales/zh/`
- Language state stored in `AppContext.appSettings.currentLanguage`
- Browser language detection via `i18next-browser-languagedetector`
- Sync i18n with app state on language changes in `App.tsx`

### Debug Mode

Access debug panel by adding `?debug=1` to URL. Shows:
- Full app state (inputs, calculations, settings)
- Useful for development and troubleshooting user-reported issues

### City Presets

`src/data/cityDefaults.ts` contains market-specific defaults:
- Home prices, rent amounts, property tax rates
- Data sourced from CRMLS and other regional MLS systems
- Applied via city selector in HeroSection

## Key Files to Understand

1. **`src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`** - Global state shape and reducer logic
2. **`src/lib/finance/calculations.ts`** - All financial calculation formulas
3. **`src/hooks/useCalculations.ts`** - Orchestrates calculations from state
4. **`src/lib/urlSync.ts`** - URL compression/decompression logic
5. **`src/data/cityDefaults.ts`** - City-specific market data
